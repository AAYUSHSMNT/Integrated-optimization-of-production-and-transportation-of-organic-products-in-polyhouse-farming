# Integrated-optimization-of-production-and-transportation-of-organic-products-in-polyhouse-farming
We carry out two-phase heuristics to integrate optimization of the production and transportation of organic products. 
Dependencies to be installed to run the model:

Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) 

Import all python modules in Anaconda environment or Jupyter notebook associated with the code ( os module , amplpy module , pyomo module , itertools module , time module , and pandas module )

Gurobi software

AMPL software

Description of running code:

Download the "model.mod" file from repository and save it in a desired location

Download all the desired data file (dat file) and save it in desired location. 

Eg. Pol200v4.dat means dat file which consist data of 200nodes and 4 different transport modes are available at each polyhouse region.

# Open the "two-phase model.ipynb" in jupyter notebook, and 

add the AMPL software folder path first

add the location for temporary directory
